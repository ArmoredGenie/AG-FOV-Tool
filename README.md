# AG-FOV-Tool for Star Citizen

Star Citizen uses vertical FOV values in it's config. This Tool will use your
desired horizontal FOV and screen resolution to calculate a vertical FOV.

It will then read the current Star Citizen config and make a local copy with
the new FOV value. You will be given the option to copy this new file into
the game directory and overrite the old one.
