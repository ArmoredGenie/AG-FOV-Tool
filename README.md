# AG-FOV-Tool for Star Citizen

Star Citizen uses vertical FOV values in it's config. This tool will use your
desired horizontal FOV and screen resolution to calculate a vertical FOV.

It will then read the current Star Citizen config and make a local copy with
the new FOV value. You will be given the option to copy this new file into
the game directory and overrite the old one.

The SC path and resolution are saved in settings.txt which looks like this by default:

settings.txt
C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE
2560
1440
